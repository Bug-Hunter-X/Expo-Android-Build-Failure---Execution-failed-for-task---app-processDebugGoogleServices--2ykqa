The solution involves several steps to ensure the `google-services.json` file is correctly integrated into the Android project:

1. **Verify `google-services.json` Existence and Placement:** Double-check that the `google-services.json` file exists within the `android/app` directory of your Expo project. If it's missing, download it from your Firebase project settings.
2. **Check File Content:** Ensure the content of the `google-services.json` file correctly matches your Firebase project's settings.  Any discrepancies will lead to build failures.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, cached files can cause conflicts. Run `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android` to clean the build environment and rebuild the project from scratch.
4. **Inspect Gradle Files:** Verify that the `google-services` plugin is correctly declared in your Android project's `build.gradle` files, specifically within the `dependencies` block. This should look similar to: `classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
`5. **Check for Conflicting Plugins or Dependencies:** Examine other Gradle plugins and dependencies, as conflicts might hinder the correct processing of the `google-services.json` file.
6. **Ensure Proper Firebase Setup:** Confirm that the Firebase project is correctly setup and linked to your Android app in the Firebase console.

If all the above steps are followed and the problem still persists, examine the full error log for more clues and consider checking other relevant Gradle configuration files.
