This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The build process fails with the message `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`.  The error message is not very descriptive, making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause. The problem is often related to the `google-services.json` file, which is essential for integrating Firebase or other Google services into your Android project.
